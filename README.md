**Controls:** Use the Arrow Keys to move your character across the map.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and rendering
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossy-road-clone.git
cd crossy-road-clone
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 💡 What I Learned

- There are materials that react to light and those that do not.
- The differences between the perspective camera and the orthographic camera in Three.js.
- Visualization of objects in the x, y, and z axes, while considering their dimensions.
- Usage of simple math operations to simulate movement on a grid.
- The importance of Math in game development such as the concepts of sine and pi.
- Basics of Three.js: creation of scenes, objects, and groups.
- Got some rough edges, but I've tackled clocks and how they are used to animate objects, as well as compute for hit detection, and player movement.
- Usage of the queue data structure.
- And the little details that become apparent only when building a project like this!

Overall, a great project to step away from constantly developing web apps.
